# 🛫 Wanderwise — Home UI Layout (Inspired by Airbnb)

A modern, intelligent travel homepage that feels lived-in, responsive, and useful — not just a static splash screen.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Not a landing page** — it’s a **personal dashboard**.
- Mix **browsing + planning** in one place.
- Prioritize **trust**, **progress**, and **exploration**.
- Clean, modular layout — no video background.
- Inspired by Airbnb, TripAdvisor, and Hopper.
